The internationalization of these two types is similar, indicating that the documents are placed in the <code>zh-cn</code> and <code>en-us</code> directories which are in the <code>docs</code> directory,according to the Chinese and English versions. The blog files are placed in the <code>zh-cn</code> and <code>en-us</code> directories,which are in the <code>blog</code> directory,according to the Chinese and English versions.</p>\n<h3>Internationalization of the rest of the site</h3>\n<p>In the <code>site_config</code> directory, the Chinese and English versions correspond to the <code>zh-cn</code> and <code>en-us</code> fields respectively, and all page-related texts need to be configured under these two fields.</p>\n",
