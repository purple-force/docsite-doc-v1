## I18n
Internationalization is divided into two parts, namely the internationalization of the markdown document and the internationalization of the rest of the site.

### Internationalization of markdown documents
The markdown document is mainly divided into explanation documents and blog documents. The internationalization of these two types is similar, indicating that the documents are placed in the `zh-cn` and `en-us` directories which are in the `docs` directory,according to the Chinese and English versions. The blog files are placed in the `zh-cn` and `en-us` directories,which are in the `blog` directory,according to the Chinese and English versions.

### Internationalization of the rest of the site
In the `site_config` directory, the Chinese and English versions correspond to the `zh-cn` and `en-us` fields respectively, and all page-related texts need to be configured under these two fields.
